lightSM light graphical session manager

DETAILS:
    lightSM is a graphical session manager build around systemd.
    it is made up out of 3 components:
    - the main daemon:
        Does the reparation for the Xserver and sets up the pam session.
        This daemon needs to be run as root to be able to set up the session.
    - the Xorg wrapper:
        launches the Xserver and exits when X is ready to receive connections.
        This daemon gets run as a user service within systemd (X11.service)
    - an optional gnome support binary
        this binary alows clean logout/shutdown/reboot from within gnome-shell

    The code in this program is majorly inspired by:
    - nodm (this is actually a fork/adaption of an unfinished rewrite of nodm)
    - user-session by Auke Kok
    - various tutorials and man page examples

    Even though this programs functionality is comparable to user-session,
    it was mostly written from scratch without knowledge about the existence of user-session.
